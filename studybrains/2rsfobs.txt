Calculating Economic Temperature: A Guide to Robust 
Derivative Estimation for Financial Time Series 
Executive Summary: This report provides a definitive guide for calculating the 
"Economic Temperature" (Θ), the fourth dimension of the Lagrangian-Entropy 
f
 inancial indicator. The core challenge lies in robustly estimating the derivative of 
market Volume with respect to Entropy, dEdVolume , from discrete and inherently noisy 
time-series data. This document establishes the conceptual, mathematical, and 
computational framework for this task. It demonstrates why a rolling linear regression 
is superior to naive methods like finite differences for this purpose. The report details 
the specific mathematical formulas for a lightweight yet powerful implementation, 
culminating in a production-ready, self-contained JavaScript function. A practical 
walkthrough with a sample dataset verifies the algorithm's correctness, providing a 
complete solution for the final phase of the indicator's development. 
Section 1: The Conceptual Framework: Using Rolling Regression 
as a Robust Differentiator 
The selection of an appropriate methodology for calculating a derivative from 
empirical data is paramount. This section establishes the theoretical justification for 
employing a rolling linear regression, framing it not as a mere computational 
convenience but as a fundamentally more sound modeling choice for the stochastic 
and noisy environment of financial markets. 
1.1 The Challenge of Differentiation in Noisy Systems 
Financial time series, such as trading volume and the derived entropy metric, are 
intrinsically noisy. This noise stems from a multitude of sources, including the discrete 
nature of trading, data measurement and aggregation artifacts, and the inherent 
stochastic variability of the economic system being modeled.1 The central analytical 
problem is to extract a meaningful signal—in this case, the derivative representing the 
sensitivity of volume to entropy changes—from a dataset where the signal-to-noise 
ratio may be low. A naive approach to differentiation can easily misinterpret random 
noise as a significant underlying pattern, leading to unreliable and erratic results. 
1.2 The Instability of Naive Finite-Difference Methods 
The most direct method for approximating a derivative is the finite-difference formula, 
such as x2 −x1 y2 −y1 . While simple, this approach is notoriously unstable and its 
accuracy deteriorates significantly when applied to noisy data.2 The reason for this 
instability is that finite-difference methods act as high-pass filters; they inherently 
amplify the high-frequency components of a signal. In financial time series, this 
high-frequency domain is dominated by noise rather than by meaningful economic 
information.5 Consequently, a single anomalous data point or a small, random 
f
 luctuation can produce a wildly inaccurate and volatile derivative estimate, rendering 
it useless for constructing a stable indicator like Economic Temperature.2 
This methodological failure arises from a fundamental mismatch between the model's 
assumptions and the reality of the data-generating process. A finite difference 
implicitly assumes a perfect, noise-free linear relationship between just two 
consecutive data points, discarding all other local information. This two-point model is 
far too simplistic to capture the underlying, noise-corrupted dynamics of a complex 
system like a financial market. The persistent failure of this method in scientific 
applications with noisy measurements is a strong indicator of its unsuitability for this 
project.2 Relying on finite differences would introduce significant, artificial volatility 
into the Temperature ( 
Θ) series, generating false signals and undermining the indicator's analytical value. 
1.3 Rolling Regression as a Localized Smoothing Differentiator 
A rolling regression provides a robust and theoretically sound alternative. This 
technique involves applying an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model repeatedly over a 
moving window of data.7 This process is conceptually analogous to applying a 
sophisticated smoothing differentiator, such as a Savitzky-Golay filter, which uses 
local polynomial regression to compute derivatives from noisy data series.5 
Instead of relying on just two points, a rolling regression utilizes an entire window of 
recent observations (e.g., 30, 60, or 100 periods) to determine the "line of best fit" 
that describes the local relationship between the change in Volume (ΔV) and the 
change in Entropy (ΔE). The slope of this line represents the average sensitivity of ΔV 
to ΔE over that specific window. This inherent averaging process naturally filters out 
the high-frequency, point-to-point noise that plagues finite differences. The result is a 
more stable, robust, and representative estimate of the local derivative.1 
The choice of the window size (temperatureWindow) is not merely a technical 
parameter but a crucial modeling decision that defines the timescale of the Economic 
Temperature. 
● A short window (e.g., 20 periods) measures a high-frequency, tactical 
temperature. It is highly responsive to recent market shifts but is also more 
susceptible to being influenced by short-term noise. 
● A long window (e.g., 252 periods, representing one year of trading days) 
measures a low-frequency, strategic temperature. It reflects a more stable, 
structural relationship but will necessarily lag in its response to new market 
regimes. 
This trade-off between responsiveness and stability is a fundamental characteristic of 
time-series analysis.7 The user must consider what kind of "temperature" they wish to 
measure: the market's minute-by-minute feverishness or its long-term climatic state. 
It is even conceivable to run the calculation with multiple window lengths in parallel to 
create a multi-timescale indicator. 
1.4 Formalizing the Regression Problem 
To estimate the derivative dEdV , the problem is framed as a simple linear regression 
that models the relationship between the changes in these two quantities. A simple 
linear regression models a response variable y as a function of a predictor variable x 
using the equation y=βx+α+ϵ, where β is the slope, α is the intercept, and ϵ is the 
error term.11 For this application, the variables are mapped as follows: 
● Response Variable (y): The change in Volume, ΔVi =Vi −Vi−1 . 
● Predictor Variable (x): The change in Entropy, ΔEi =Ei −Ei−1 . 
● Target Coefficient (β): The slope of the regression of ΔV on ΔE. This slope, β, 
serves as the robust estimate of the derivative dEdV . The intercept, α, represents 
any baseline drift in ΔV that is independent of changes in ΔE and is not needed 
for the calculation of Temperature.

Section 2: Mathematical Foundations for a Lightweight 
Implementation 
This section details the specific mathematical formulas required to implement the 
rolling regression. The focus is on a computationally efficient approach that avoids 
reliance on heavy external statistical libraries, making the final code self-contained 
and performant. 
2.1 The Principle of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
The method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the cornerstone of linear regression. It 
determines the optimal values for the slope (β) and intercept (α) by minimizing the 
sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent 
variable (yi ) and the values predicted by the regression line (y^ i ). This quantity is 
known as the Sum of Squared Residuals (or Errors), SSE.1 
SSE=i=1∑N (yi −y^ i )2=i=1∑N (yi −(α+βxi ))2 
This minimization problem can be solved analytically using calculus, which yields 
closed-form solutions for β and α. This is a critical advantage, as it allows for direct 
calculation of the coefficients without resorting to more complex iterative optimization 
algorithms like gradient descent.15 
2.2 The Standard Formula for the Slope Coefficient (β) 
The standard textbook formula for the slope coefficient β (often denoted as b1 or β^ 1 
in sample estimations) is expressed in terms of the covariance between x and y and 
the variance of x.13 
$$ \beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(x, y)}{\text{Var}(x)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} $$ 
Here, xˉ and yˉ are the sample means of the x and y values within the window, and N is 
the number of data points in that window. While this formula is statistically intuitive, it 
is computationally inefficient for a rolling implementation. At each step of the main 
loop, it would require a full pass over the window's data to calculate the means (xˉ, yˉ ), 
followed by a second pass to calculate the sums of deviations. This results in an 
O(2W) operation for each time step, where W is the window size. 
2.3 A Computationally Efficient Formula for Implementation 
Through algebraic expansion, the standard formula can be transformed into a "raw 
sums" or "computational" formula that is mathematically equivalent but does not 
require the pre-calculation of means.18 This form is ideal for a lightweight 
implementation. 
β=N∑(xi2 )−(∑xi )2N∑(xi yi )−(∑xi )(∑yi ) 
This formula is the key to a performant implementation. To calculate the slope for any 
given window, one only needs to compute five simple sums over the (x,y) pairs (i.e., 
the (ΔE,ΔV) pairs) within that window: 
1. N: The number of pairs. 
2. ∑x: The sum of the x values. 
3. ∑y: The sum of the y values. 
4. ∑xy: The sum of the products of x and y. 
5. ∑x2: The sum of the squared x values. 
These five sums can be calculated in a single pass (an O(W) operation) through the 
window's data at each time step, which is significantly more efficient than the 
two-pass method required by the standard formula. 
For applications requiring maximum performance, such as high-frequency analysis on 
very large datasets, this calculation can be further optimized. When the window slides 
forward by one time step, one data point is removed and one is added. Instead of 
re-calculating the five sums over the entire new window, they can be updated in 
constant time, O(1). For example, the new sum of x is simply the old sum of x minus 
the value that fell out of the window, plus the new value that entered. This "updating 
and downdating" technique is the most efficient method for implementing rolling 
calculations 9, though the single-pass O(W) approach is already very fast and suitable 
for most applications. 
Section 3: Production-Ready JavaScript Implementation 
This section translates the conceptual and mathematical framework into a complete, 
commented, and robust JavaScript function. The code is designed to be 
self-contained, easy to integrate, and resilient to common data issues. 
3.1 Function Signature and API Design 
As specified, the function is named calculateTemperature and adheres to the 
following API: 
calculateTemperature(data, options) 
● data: An array of objects. Each object in the array must contain numerical 
properties for entropy and volume. 
● options: A configuration object. It must contain the key temperatureWindow, 
which specifies the integer lookback period for the rolling regression. 
● Return Value: The function returns a new array, identical in length to the input 
data array. Each object in the returned array is a copy of the original, augmented 
with a new temperature property. This practice of returning a new array ensures 
the immutability of the original input data, which is a critical best practice in 
modern software development. 
3.2 Core Implementation Logic: The Rolling Calculation 
The function's core logic consists of a primary loop that iterates through the input 
data to perform the rolling calculation. 
1. Iteration: The main loop iterates from the second data point (i = 1) to the end of 
the array, as the first difference calculation requires the point at i-1. 
2. Delta Calculation: Inside the loop, the one-step changes, ΔE (our x variable) and 
ΔV (our y variable), are calculated. These changes are stored temporarily. 
3. Window Management: For each time step, the code checks if enough historical 
Δ values have been accumulated to form a complete window. The regression 
requires a window of temperatureWindow - 1 pairs of (ΔE,ΔV). 
4. Summation: Once a full window is available, a nested loop iterates through the 
relevant window of Δ pairs to compute the five essential sums (N, ∑x, ∑y, ∑xy, ∑x2) 
as defined by the efficient formula in Section 2.3. 
3.3 Robustness and Edge-Case Management 
A production-quality implementation must gracefully handle edge cases and potential 
numerical instabilities. 
● Initialization Period: For the initial indices where a full window of data is not yet 
available, the temperature property is set to null. This "burn-in" period is a 
standard and correct way to handle rolling calculations, acknowledging that a 
stable estimate cannot be produced without sufficient data.8 
● Zero-Variance Predictor: A critical check is implemented before the final division 
in the slope formula. The denominator, N∑(x2)−(∑x)2, is mathematically equivalent 
to N2×Var(x). If this term is zero or extremely close to zero (checked against a 
small epsilon), it signifies that the predictor variable, ΔE, had no variance across 
the entire window. 
○ This is not merely a numerical error but a meaningful economic signal. It 
represents a state of "infinite stiffness" or zero sensitivity, where changes in 
Volume have become completely decoupled from changes in Entropy. In this 
state, the derivative dEdV is effectively zero. 
○ Since Temperature Θ=∣β∣1 , a slope β of zero implies an infinite temperature. 
The implementation handles this by checking the denominator. If it is near 
zero, the slope is treated as zero, and the resulting temperature is set to 
Infinity to correctly represent this market state. This prevents division-by-zero 
errors while preserving the economic meaning of the event.17 
● Temperature Calculation: The final step calculates Θ as 1 / Math.abs(slope). As 
requested, the absolute value is used to focus on the magnitude of the market's 
sensitivity, not its direction. The proportionality constant is ignored, as the relative 
changes in Temperature are the primary object of analysis. 
3.4 The Complete calculateTemperature Function 
The following self-contained JavaScript function implements the complete logic 
described above.

        } else {

        // The `i`-th delta corresponds to original data point `i+1`. 
        results[i + 1].temperature = temperature; 
    } 
 
    return results; 
} 
 
 
Section 4: Practical Walkthrough and Verification 
To ensure clarity and provide a verifiable example, this section demonstrates the 
calculation for a single window using a small sample dataset. This makes the abstract 
formulas and code logic tangible. 
4.1 Sample Data and Parameters 
Consider the following sample data array containing 10 time steps of entropy and 
volume. 
Sample Input Data: 
JavaScript 
const sampleData = [ 
{ entropy: 2.1, volume: 1000 }, // index 0 
{ entropy: 2.2, volume: 1050 }, // index 1 
{ entropy: 2.15, volume: 1020 },// index 2 
{ entropy: 2.25, volume: 1100 },// index 3 
{ entropy: 2.3, volume: 1150 }, // index 4 
{ entropy: 2.28, volume: 1140 },// index 5 
{ entropy: 2.35, volume: 1200 },// index 6 
{ entropy: 2.4, volume: 1250 }, // index 7 
{ entropy: 2.38, volume: 1220 },// index 8 
{ entropy: 2.42, volume: 1280 } // index 9 
]; 
The chosen parameter for this walkthrough is temperatureWindow = 5. This means the 
rolling regression will be performed on a window of 5 - 1 = 4 pairs of (ΔE,ΔV). 
4.2 Step-by-Step Calculation for a Single Window 
 
The first valid temperature value can be calculated at index 4 of the original 
sampleData array, as this is the first point where a full lookback window of 5 data 
points (and thus 4 delta pairs) is available. 
The regression window uses the delta pairs calculated from indices 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Table 4.1: Windowed Data and First Differences (ΔE,ΔV) 
 
Index (i) entropy (Ei ) volume (Vi ) ΔE (x=Ei −Ei−1 ) ΔV (y=Vi −Vi−1 ) 
1 2.20 1050 0.10 50 
2 2.15 1020 -0.05 -30 
3 2.25 1100 0.10 80 
4 2.30 1150 0.05 50 
The regression is performed on the four (x,y) pairs shown in the last two columns. 
Table 4.2: Intermediate Sums for Slope Calculation 
 
Term Calculation Value 
N Number of pairs in the window 4 
∑x 0.10 + (-0.05) + 0.10 + 0.05 0.20 
∑y 50 + (-30) + 80 + 50 150 
∑xy (0.10*50) + (-0.05*-30) + 
(0.10*80) + (0.05*50) 
5 + 1.5 + 8 + 2.5 = 17 
∑x2 (0.10)² + (-0.05)² + (0.10)² + 
(0.05)² 
0.01 + 0.0025 + 0.01 + 
0.0025 = 0.025 
 
4.3 Final Coefficient and Temperature Calculation 
With the intermediate sums calculated, they are now substituted into the efficient 
formula for the slope coefficient, β. 
β=N∑(x2)−(∑x)2N∑(xy)−(∑x)(∑y) β=4×0.025−(0.20)24×17−(0.20)(150) β=0.1−0.0468−30 
=0.0638 ≈633.33 
The slope β, which is our estimate for dEdV , is approximately 633.33. Finally, the 
Economic Temperature (Θ) is calculated as the inverse of the absolute value of this 
slope. 
Θ=∣β∣1 =∣633.33∣1 ≈0.001579 
Therefore, the calculated temperature for the data point at index 4 would be 
approximately 0.001579. This process is then repeated for each subsequent time 
step, rolling the window forward one period at a time to generate the complete 
Temperature time series.
